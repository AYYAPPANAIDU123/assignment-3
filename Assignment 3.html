            <h3>Junior cricket in Bihar</h3>
            <p>n 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bihar+cricket+association">Bihar Cricket Association</a>  Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division.Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team.Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.</p>
            <h3>Jharkhand cricket team</h3>
            <p>Dhoni made his <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ranji+trophy"> Ranji Trophy</a> debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team.[ Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season. Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.
            </p>
            <h2>India A team
            </h2>
            <p>He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. <mark>Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match</mark>. In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century.

Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=indian+captains"> Indian captain</a> – Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.

            <h2>Start of ODI career
            </h2>
            <p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent. The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads. With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05. Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series</p>
            <h2>2007 World Cup</h2>
            <p><mark>He was also elected as the captain of the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007</mark> after seniors players like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble refused to be part of T20 format. India won the first ever ICC World Twenty20 Tournament by defeating Pakistan in Final making India's first solo ICC Trophy Win since 1983. The world cup win saw Dhoni as future captain of Indian cricket team in all formats.

                On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equalled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one</p>

                <h2>Test career</h2>
                <p>Following his one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the Indian teams' Test wicket-keeper. Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain. Dhoni came to the crease when the team was at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling in quick succession, he played an aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed. Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second Test and his quick scoring rate (50 off 51 balls) helped India set a target of 436, where the Sri Lankans were then bowled out for 247.
                    <h2>T20I career
                    </h2>
                    <p>On 12 February 2012, Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide India to their first win over Australia at Adelaide. In the final over, <mark>he hit considerably large six which travelled 112 meters off the bowling of Clint McKay</mark>. During the post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup final in 2011.[138]

                    <img src="msd4.jpeg"/>
                    <p><mark>Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket on 15 August 2020</mark>. The decision came as a surprise to many fans and cricket experts, as Dhoni had not announced any plans to retire before that. He had not played any international cricket since India's loss in the 2019 Cricket World Cup semi-final. He also had not announced any plans to retire from domestic cricket, and continues to play for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.
